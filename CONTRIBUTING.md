# How to Contribute

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

Start by forking this repository to your own GitHub account. You'll need it to make your contributions.

### Step 2: Solve a Challenge

Choose a coding challenge from your preferred platform (e.g., LeetCode, CodeForces, CodeChef) and write a solution in your favorite programming language. Follow our naming convention:

`<question_number>_<question_name>.<file_extension>`

For example: `1_hello_world.cpp`

If the question does not have any question number, name it as:

`<question_name>.<file_extension>`

Save the file in the <b>platform specific</b> folder.

For example: You are solving a coding challenge from LeetCode, save the file into the `LeetCode` folder.

If the folder for your platform does not exists, create a new folder and rename it according to your platform and add your files.

### Step 3: Add Comments

Inside your code file, add the URL of the question as a comment at the top. Additionally, provide a clear explanation of your approach using block comments. Don't forget to mention the time and space complexity.
